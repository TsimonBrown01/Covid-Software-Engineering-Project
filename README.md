# Covid-Software-Engineering-Project
This is my first time uploading a project on github, so i made it my first software engineering project.
I built this all in one week after taking a speedrun course, (spending an afternoon on an online tutorial), but I am proud of what I did.
I hope to comeback and learn how to imporve the project overtime.

First, I used a private server. PhPAdmin to store the survey data on a database. Another trial I had to learn to overcome. 
Second, I am aware that it is all subjected to SQL injection. 
Third, I do hope that if anyone has any suggestions on how to improve this, please do leave comment.
